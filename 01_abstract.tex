Images of the eye are key in several computer vision problems, such as facial feature localization and gaze estimation.
Recent large-scale supervised methods for these problems require time-consuming data collection and manual annotation, which can be unreliable.
We propose synthesizing perfectly labelled photo-realistic training data in a fraction of the time.
We used computer graphics techniques to build a collection of dynamic eye-region models from head scan geometry.
These were randomly posed to synthesize close-up eye images for a wide range of head poses, gaze directions, and illumination conditions.
We demonstrate the benefits of our synthesized training data (\dataset) by out-performing state-of-the-art methods for eye-shape registration in the wild, and achieving competitive performance on appearance-based gaze estimation.
Furthermore, we show that its important to include realistic illumination and shape variation in training data.
