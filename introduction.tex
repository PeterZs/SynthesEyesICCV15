\section{Introduction}

\todo{Intro to motivate why we came up with our rendering method}

In this paper we describe our approach for generating photorealistic training data, and then present and evaluate two systems trained on \dataset: an eye-region specific deformable model and an appearance-based gaze estimator. These systems are case studies that show how we leverage the degrees of control made available by rendering our training data to easily and quickly generate high quality training datasets.
