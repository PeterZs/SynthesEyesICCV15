\section{Introduction}

Machine learning approaches that leverage large amounts of image data are currently the best solutions to many problems in computer vision \todo{cite}. However, capturing or collecting images can be extremely time consuming, especially for new areas of research without pre-existing datasets. Supervised learning approaches then require that the images are labelled. This annotation process can be expensive and tedious, and there is no guarantee the labels will be correct.

In this paper we describe our approach for generating photorealistic training data, and then present and evaluate two systems trained on \dataset: an eye-region specific deformable model and an appearance-based gaze estimator. These systems are case studies that show how we leverage the degrees of control made available by rendering our training data to easily and quickly generate high quality training datasets.
