abstract = {Eye tracking is compelling for hands-free interaction with pervasive displays. However, most existing eye tracking systems require specialised hardware and explicit calibrations of equipment and individual users, which inhibit their widespread adoption. In this work, we present a light-weight and calibration-free gaze estimation method that leverages only an off-the-shelf camera to track users\' gaze horizontally. We introduce pupil-canthi-ratio (PCR), a novel measure for estimating gaze directions. By using the displacement vector between the inner eye corner and the pupil centre of an eye, PCR is calculated as the ratio of the displacement vectors from both eyes. We establish a mapping between PCR to gaze direction by Gaussian process regression, which inherently infers averted horizontal gaze directions of users. We present a study to identify the characteristics of PCR. The results show that PCR achieved an average accuracy of 3.9 degrees across different people. Finally, we show examples of real-time applications of PCR that allow users to interact with a display by moving only their eyes.},

abstract = {Public displays can be made interactive by adding gaze control. However, gaze interfaces do not offer any physical affordance, and require users to move into a tracking range. We present GazeHorizon, a system that provides interactive assistance to enable passers-by to walk up to a display and to navigate content using their eyes only. The system was developed through field studies culminating in a four-day deployment in a public environment. Our results show that novice users can be facilitated to successfully use gaze control by making them aware of the interface at first glance and guiding them interactively into the tracking range.},

abstract = {Appearance-based gaze estimation is believed to work well in real-world settings but existing datasets were collected under controlled laboratory conditions and methods were not evaluated across multiple datasets. In this work we study appearance-based gaze estimation in the wild. We present the MPIIGaze dataset that contains 213,659 images we collected from 15 participants during natural everyday laptop use over more than three months. Our dataset is significantly more variable than existing datasets with respect to appearance and illumination. We also present a method for in-the-wild appearance-based gaze estimation using multimodal convolutional neural networks, which significantly outperforms state-of-the art methods in the most challenging cross-dataset evaluation setting. We present an extensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art image-based gaze estimation algorithm on three current datasets, including our own. This evaluation provides clear insights and allows us identify key research challenges of gaze estimation in the wild.},
