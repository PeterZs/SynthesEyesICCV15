\subsection{use cases}

eyelid detection

eye corner detection

eye bounding box detection

gaze estimation

eye position detection?

\subsection{evaluations}

train on synthesised images and show competitive performance on MPIIgaze with real images

show that we can synthesise specific datasets for specific settings (specific head and gaze ranges, illumination conditions), show that we can competitive performance

person-adaptation, use pre-trained model from synthesised data, then personalise with small amount of user-specific data

show better performance than UT dataset
