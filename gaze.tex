\section{Experiments}

evaluate eye/gaze/eyelid shapes (fully synthetic) separately from full face appearance (which is a mixture of real and synthetic data)

does photorealistic data really help/is it necessary? either reduce quality and see how it affects performance, or compare model with and without shape variations

show that we only need data from few(er) people and show competitive performance

train on synthesised images and show competitive performance on MPIIgaze with real images

show that we can synthesise specific datasets for specific settings (specific head and gaze ranges, illumination conditions), show that we can competitive performance

person-adaptation, use pre-trained model from synthesised data, then personalise with small amount of user-specific data

show better performance than UT dataset


\subsection{use cases}

eyelid detection

\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluate eyelid landmark accuracy on LFW and M-PIE data, compare against several state-of-the-art CLM methods
    \item Evaluate eyelid and iris landmarks on annotated MPII data, compare against baseline method: majority vote for iris position
\end{itemize}

eye corner detection

eye bounding box detection

gaze estimation

eye position detection?
