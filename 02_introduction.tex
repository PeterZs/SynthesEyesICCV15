% Looks like the template doesn't allow us to do this easily unfortunately :(

Machine learning methods that leverage large amounts of training data currently perform best for many problems in computer vision, such as object detection, scene recognition, or gaze estimation~\cite{zhou2014learning,girshick2014rich,zhang15_cvpr}.
However, capturing data for supervised learning can be time-consuming and require accurate ground truth annotation.
% capturing or collecting large-scale training data can be time-consuming
%, especially for new areas of research without pre-existing datasets.
% and supervised learning methods additionally require accurate ground truth annotation for each image.
This annotation process can be expensive and tedious, and there is no guarantee that human-provided labels will be correct.
Ground truth annotation is particularly challenging and error-prone for learning tasks that require accurate labels, such as tracking facial landmarks for expression analysis, and gaze estimation.

To address these problems, researchers have employed \emph{learning-by-synthesis} techniques to generate large amounts training data with computer graphics.
The advantages of this approach are that both data collection and annotation require little human labour and image synthesis can be geared to specific application scenarios.
Perhaps the best known example is by \citet{shotton2013real}, who synthesized a large and varied depth-image dataset for training a real-time pose-estimator.

\commentE{Will add a affective computing reference here.}
The eyes and their movements are important for a range of applications including gaze-based human-computer interaction~\cite{majaranta14_apc}, visual behaviour monitoring~\cite{bulling13_chi,bulling11_pami}, and -- more recently -- computer vision tasks, such as object recognition and detection~\cite{yun2013studying,papadopoulos2014training,karthikeyan2013and}.
The eye-region is particularly difficult to model accurately given the dynamic shape changes it undergoes with facial motion and eyeball rotation, and the complex material structure of the eyeball itself.
For this reason, recent work on learning-by-synthesis for gaze estimation employed only fundamental computer graphics techniques -- rendering low-resolution meshes without modelling illumination changes or accounting for the varying material properties of the face \cite{sugano2014learning,lu2012head}.
In addition, these models are not fully controllable and the synthesized datasets contain only gaze labels, limiting their usefulness for other computer vision problems, such as facial landmark registration.
%\commentA{what about Leszeks work? should also fit in here, right?}

% \commentA{we can also remove these last references if we have to save space}
% Recent work by \citet{sugano2014learning} demonstrated the benefits of learning-by-synthesis for appearance-based gaze estimation, but employed only fundamental computer graphics techniques for synthesising low-resolution meshes that did not account for lighting variation.

% It is for this reason that previous work on rendering photorealistic images of the eye and eye-region is relatively sparse~\cite{ActiBlizEyes,berard2014highquality}.
% \commentY{What does this "sparsity" mean? And again, I think having 10 different models is a little to weak to say that it can handle "significant variation in facial shape and texture across different people" in the context of face/eye research.}

% \commentA{we also need to motivate why high quality renderings are needed, i.e. why it's worthwhile to put so much effort into the model. And later we can hopefully also show that it pays off to do so...}

% Andreas: we need some transition to eyeballs here, e.g. eyeball rendering is particularly challenging and interesting because of the many muscles involved, the large number of appearance details around and in the eye etc.
% essentially motivate that this hasn't been done before and is a very interesting area of research

%Synthesising training data is not novel in itself -- previous work has ... Our novel approach 

\input{figs/fig_process.tex}

We present a novel method for rendering realistic eye-region images at a large scale using a collection of dynamic and controllable eye-region models.
In contrast to previous work, we provide a comprehensive and detailed description of the model preparation process and rendering pipeline (see~\autoref{fig:process} for an overview of the model preparation process and~\autoref{fig:eye_model} for the eye model used).
We then present and evaluate two separate systems trained on the resulting data (\emph{\dataset}): an eye-region specific deformable model and an appearance-based gaze estimator.
The controllability of our model allows us to quickly generate high-quality training data for these two disparate tasks.
% These systems are case studies that show how we use the controllability made possible by our model to easily and quickly generate high-quality training datasets.
%\commentE{I'm not sure about this sentence - gaze estimation and eye-registration are both valuable systems, ``illustration purposes only'' makes them sound like toy examples (but I get your idea)}
Please note
%that we picked these two examples as use cases only.
% Think about rewording or explaining this better
that our model is not only limited to these scenarios but can potentially be used for other tasks that require realistic images of eyes, e.g. evaluation of iris-biometrics or gaze correction.

The specific contributions of this work are threefold.
%First, we present our dynamic eye-region model that uses multiple parts and blend shapes to model the continuous degrees of shape change and deformation exhibited by the eye.
%
We describe in detail our novel but straight-forward techniques for generating large amounts of synthesized training data, including wide degrees of realistic appearance variation using image-based-lighting.
%
We then demonstrate the usefulness of \dataset for eye-shape registration, where we outperform the state-of-the-art, and \commentA{insert key appearance-based gaze estimation result here}
%
Finally, to ensure reproducibility and stimulate research in this area we will make the eyeball model and generated training data publicly available at time of publication.
