\subsection{Learning Using Synthetic Data}

While learning-based approaches have been recognised as promising solutions for various computer vision tasks, the gap between training and test data is still causing practical issues.
It is still not a trivial task for learning algorithms to handle unknown test data, and their performances often depend on how well the test data distribution is covered by the training data.
One of the most straightforward solution is to use enough amount of training data which can cover the whole variation of potential test data; however, it is not always possible to obtaining real training data in this manner.
The use of purely synthetic training data has been considered as a promising solution to address this issue.
It has been shown that synthetic training data is beneficial to various tasks including body pose estimation~\cite{shakhnarovich2003fast,okada2008relevant,shotton2013real}, head pose estimation~\cite{fanelli2011real} and object detection/recognition~\cite{yu2010improving,liebelt2010multiview,jaderberg2014synthetic}.
These works used 3D models, from a single 3D CAD object to deformable human body shape, to synthesise huge amount of training images for the target task.
\commentY{CAD-based multi-view object recognition has a lot of works, though I don't think we need to cite them all}

As discussed in Kaneva et al.,~\cite{kaneva2011evaluation} \commentY{In some sense this is an important reference for our story}, one of the most important factors to be considered is the reality of synthesised training images.
If the target object is highly complex like human eyes, it is not clear whether we can rely on simple object models.
Most similar to this work, Sugano et al.~\cite{sugano2014learning} used 3D reconstructions of human eye regions to synthesise multi-view training data for appearance-based gaze estimation.
However, Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang15_cvpr} pointed out that the estimation accuracy significantly drops when the test data is obtained from a completely new environment.
Similarly to the case of facial expression recognition~\cite{stratou2011effect}, illumination condition is often a critical factor for computer vision tasks, and the change of viewpoints is not enough to cover the test data variability.
\commentY{this line should be adjusted according to the result}
In contrast, our model allows...

\commentY{reality and controllability should be both important, while currently the story focuses on the reality side. but this point is rather related to the next section (Computer Generated Eyes) maybe?}
Another limitation of Sugano et al.'s dataset~\cite{sugano2014learning} is that they do not provide a parametric model.
Their data is essentially a set of rigid and low-resolution 3D models of eye regions with their ground-truth gaze directions, and hence cannot be easily applied to different tasks.
The scope of a realistic eye model for learning-based approach is not limited to the appearance-based gaze estimation task, but the model can be also applied to, e.g., eye shape registration task.
Since our model is fully synthetic, it can be also used to synthesise close-up eye images with ground-truth eye landmark positions.
This enables us to address the eye shape registration task via the learning-by-synthesis approach for the first time.

\subsection{Computer Generated Eyes}

\commentA{first paragraph: other body parts, then
second paragraph: In contrast, the problem of modelling the human eye has received considerably less attention.

%\cite{bohme2008software}

The eyeballs are complex organs comprised of multiple layers of tissue, each with different reflectance properties and levels of transparency.
Fortunately, given that rendering realistic eyes is important for many areas in computer graphics (CG), there is already a large body of previous work on modelling and rendering eyes (see~\cite{ruhland2014look} for a recent survey).
