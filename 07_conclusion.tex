\section{Conclusion}

% One limitation of our model is that we only model natural eyelid movement following vertical saccades, and not the full range of deformation that accompanies other expressions like squinting, nose-wrinkling, or brow movements.
% Additionally, as blend shapes were defined manually there is no guarantee they are anatomically correct.

We presented a novel method to synthesise perfectly labelled realistic close-up images of the human eye.
At the core of our method is a computer graphics pipeline that uses a collection of dynamic eye-region models obtained from head scans to generate images for a wide range of head poses, gaze directions, and illumination conditions.
We demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for eye-shape registration in the wild, and achieves competitive performance on appearance-based gaze estimation.
These results are promising and underline the significant potential of such learning-by-synthesis approaches particularly in combination with large-scale supervised methods.
