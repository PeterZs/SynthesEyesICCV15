High-quality images of the human eye are required in the study of several computer vision problems, such as facial feature detection and tracking, gaze estimation, or gaze correction.
In particular recent large-scale supervised methods require the tedious and time-consuming collection and often manual annotation of large amounts of training images.
%, which is error-prone and slows down progress in these areas.
We present a novel method to synthesise photorealistic images of the human eye for arbitrary head poses, gaze directions, and lighting conditions.

We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on the sample problems of eyelid detection and gaze estimation.
