High-quality images of the human eye are required in the study of several computer vision problems, such as facial feature detection and tracking, gaze estimation, or gaze correction.
In particular recent large-scale supervised methods require tedious and time-consuming collection and typically manual annotation of large amounts of training images.
%, which is error-prone and slows down progress in these areas.
We present a novel method to synthesise photorealistic close-up images of the human eye for arbitrary head poses, gaze directions, and lighting conditions.
At the core of our method is a dynamic eye-region model that we \todo{briefly describe what this model involves and how it was generated}
The model is able to simulate the large variability of real eyes, including pupil dilation, eyelid motion and corresponding changes in its shape, as well as iris colour variations.
%dynamic changes in shape
We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on the sample problems of eyelid detection and appearance-based gaze estimation.
We show that \todo{results}
